# Bioinformatics

#### OMICs DATA ######
the post genomic era has rediated its influnence and brought about advances in the pursuit of information underpinning
other biological entities

Genes --> genomics
proteins --> Proteomics
Sugar --> Glycomics
Lipds --> Lipidomics
Metabolites --> Metabolomics
Molecular Intercations --> interactomics

In the case of drug-design we consider protein-ligand interactions, so we use interactOMICs.

OMICs (provides basic informations of disease) + Precision Medicine +  Bioinfromatics

OMICS data are often large and complex and reliant on Bioinformatics technology to make sense and 
translate such data to actionable insights 

Bioinformatics is a field that applies statistics and information theory to 
make sense of biological data

Bioinformtics lies at the interface of bilogy and computer science 

Common Tasks in Bioinformatics

Search --> search public databases for information on genes/proteins/RNA/pathways (PDB, UNIProt)
Compare --> sequence alighment to discern similarity/differnces amongst varous genes/proteins/RNA
Model --> Build structural model of protein structure (homology modeling for protein) and build predictive models 
using retrospective data
Integrate and curate --> combine heterogeneous data sources, redundancy 

Computational Bilogy --> Applies computational techniques to understand bilogy
Bioinformatics --> Involves the devlopment of algorithms and tools to analyze and solve bilogical data

Bioinformatics Tools --> databases, softwares, webservers that allow users to retrieve , 
analyze and gain insights from bilogical data
